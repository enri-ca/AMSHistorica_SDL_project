# Historica_pro
The project initially started with the aim of analysing from a technical viewpoint, the migration of the University of Bologna AMS Historica digital library from an in-house system to a new commercial platform based on DSpace-GLAM.
Due to few information about the old system and the really early stage of the migration in early 2022, that did not allow to have enough information about the new platform, I have briefly illustrated the key point of the future digital library platform to then concentrate on a simulated semantic translation of a sample of records to envisage the possible problems that could have to be faced in using the DC metadata current description in a web semantic context.
I started by using as long as possible a sort of “DCMI translation” but I soon realized that a framework, fully describing the complex relationship between the original item and its digitization, required a higher specialized ontology to be expressed. 
Analyzing then the library-bibliographic’s world related ontologies - as LRMoo, FABIO, Bibframe, etc. - I found really useful properties in the RDA family.
Two turtle serializations file for the first attempt on 31 items, ad the second more complex on 3 item are offered togheter with their rdfgrafer visualization.
